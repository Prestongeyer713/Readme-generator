# Readme-generator
This application utilizes node.js to run javascript in the command line.
This application was designed so that you can create a profesional readme file from the command line.
When you open the command line and navigate to the correct file you can run node index.js
From there it will display a series of questions to fill out your readme.
Unfortunatly I dont have too much knowledge of node.js so I wasnt able to make it print the readme after all information was entered.
I hope to come back to this project and make it work properly once I understand node.js better.
