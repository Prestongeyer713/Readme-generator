# Readme-generator
This application utilizes node.js to run javascript in the command line.
This application was designed so that you can create a profesional readme file from the command line.
When you open the command line and navigate to the correct file you can run node index.js
From there it will display a series of questions to fill out your readme.
I was able to learn alot about node.js in a short amount of time.
